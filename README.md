# :alarm_clock: Clock App

The idea of this project I had when was in Windows lock screen about to enter my account, so I decided to create something like that.

The app gets daily background image and quotes.

Demo - https://clock-app.bridges.vercel.app/

#### What APIs I used:

- Quotes - https://type.fit/api/quotes
- Current position address (Geocoding) - https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org
- Daily background images - https://source.unsplash.com

#### Features I'd want to create but had no time:

- User greeting message
- Weather widget based on user address
